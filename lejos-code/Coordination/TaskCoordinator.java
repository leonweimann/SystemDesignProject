/**
 * The TaskCoordinator class is responsible for managing the execution of tasks
 * within the system. It follows the Singleton design pattern to ensure that
 * only one instance of the TaskCoordinator exists. The class maintains the
 * current phase of the system and provides methods to execute tasks and update
 * the phase.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The TaskCoordinator initializes the system in the BOOTING phase and
 * transitions through different phases based on the system's state. It
 * retrieves and runs tasks corresponding to the current phase.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Usage example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * TaskCoordinator coordinator = TaskCoordinator.getInstance();
 * coordinator.execute();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
