/**
 * The LightFluctuationController class is responsible for coordinating and
 * managing multiple light sensors.
 * It provides higher-level functionality for analyzing light data from multiple
 * sensors and determining if significant fluctuations are occurring.
 * This class uses instances of LightSensorAdapter to read and analyze data from
 * each sensor, and potentially aggregate data for comparison.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Manage multiple LightSensorAdapter instances.
 * - Compare light values between different sensors.
 * - Detect synchronized or significant fluctuations in light data across
 * multiple sensors.
 * - Provide methods to aggregate and analyze light intensity data from multiple
 * sources.
